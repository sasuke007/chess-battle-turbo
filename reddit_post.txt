I’m building a way to play those "Pause the Video" moments from Agadmator with your friends 


Hey everyone,

I’ve always had this frustration: I’ll be watching an Agadmator video, I’ll pause it, find the “winning” move, and then... that’s it. In a real game, finding the move is only half the battle. You still have to actually convert the win, which is way harder than it looks (especially for us mere mortals).

So, I’m building a chess app focused entirely on endgames and critical positions.

The two main features so far:

    Agadmator Mode: I’m feeding in all the "pause the video" moments from the channel so you can jump straight into the position and play it out against a friend online**.**

    FIDE Scenarios: It pulls random endgame positions from actual pro games to see if you can hold the draw or find the mate under pressure.

I’m aiming to launch the beta in about 15 days.(15th Jan)

I’d love your feedback: What else would make this actually useful for your training?

Cheers!!

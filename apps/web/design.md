Color: White (#FFFFFF).

Size: Make it large and prominent (e.g., 48px).

Alignment: Center the text.

Spacing: Add slightly generous letter spacing.

Then there will be 3 points in a list vertically aligned

Header Section:

- Main Title: ‚ÄúTrusted by Teams, Loved by Users‚Äù
  - Font: Sans-serif, modern, clean, and bold.
  - Color: White (#FFFFFF).
  - Size: Large and prominent (e.g., 48px).

- Main Testimonial Card (Front):
  - Shape: Dark gray, rounded rectangular card (#1A1A1A or similar dark shade).
  - Quote: ‚ÄúHoory has completely transformed the way we manage time and productivity.‚Äù
  - Font: Sans-serif, bold or semi-bold.
  - Color: White (#FFFFFF).
  - Size: Medium-large (e.g., 24px), clearly the main focus of the card.

Behind Testimonial Cards (Stacked and Tilted):

They are subtly rotated or skewed (tilted) at a small angle (e.g., -5 to +5 degrees) and slightly offset, making their edges visible behind the main card.

The text on these background cards is even more faded or illegible, suggesting they are inactive or ‚Äúnext‚Äù in a sequence. For instance, the left background card shows only glimpses of letters like ‚Äò‚ÄùH\nwi\nW‚Äù‚Äô.

Carousel Navigation (Bottom):

A series of small, horizontal, rounded rectangular indicators.

One indicator (corresponding to the active, front testimonial) is solid white.

Positioned centrally below the testimonial stack, with vertical padding.

General Styling Notes:

- Subtle use of dark gray tones against a black background adds depth, particularly in the card stacking section.

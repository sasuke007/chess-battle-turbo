A web section with a dark, almost black background (#0A0A0A) features a header, a subtitle, and a stack of testimonial cards. The main card is prominently displayed in front, while the other cards are partially visible and tilted behind it, creating a depth effect.

Header Section:

- Main Title: “Trusted by Teams, Loved by Users”
  - Font: Sans-serif, modern, clean, and bold.
  - Color: White (#FFFFFF).
  - Size: Large and prominent (e.g., 48px).
  - Alignment: Centered.

Testimonial Stack (Below Header):

- Main Testimonial Card (Front):
  - Shape: Dark gray, rounded rectangular card (#1A1A1A or similar dark shade).
  - Quote: “Hoory has completely transformed the way we manage time and productivity.”
  - Font: Sans-serif, bold or semi-bold.
  - Color: White (#FFFFFF).
  - Size: Medium-large (e.g., 24px), clearly the main focus of the card.

Behind Testimonial Cards (Stacked and Tilted):

One or more additional cards are positioned behind the main card.

These cards are darker in shade (e.g., #0F0F0F) and slightly blurred or desaturated.

They are subtly rotated or skewed (tilted) at a small angle (e.g., -5 to +5 degrees) and slightly offset, making their edges visible behind the main card.

The text on these background cards is even more faded or illegible, suggesting they are inactive or “next” in a sequence. For instance, the left background card shows only glimpses of letters like ‘”H\nwi\nW”’.

Carousel Navigation (Bottom):

A series of small, horizontal, rounded rectangular indicators.

One indicator (corresponding to the active, front testimonial) is solid white.


The other indicators are dark gray with a white outline, representing inactive states.

Positioned centrally below the testimonial stack, with vertical padding.

General Styling Notes:

- Ample negative space surrounds elements, enhancing readability.
- Subtle use of dark gray tones against a black background adds depth, particularly in the card stacking section.
- Emphasis is placed on the quotes to build credibility.

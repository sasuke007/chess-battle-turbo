read clerk documentation, and figure out how can we implement custom sign in page.

Add transitions between pages.

remove invite code from game table everything will be done using game reference id.


Clocks are not refreshing.

Moves are not working.

By default queen promotion is enabled. Need to give user to select the piece for promotion.

Write a reddit post describing idea and attach a working waitlist.

Also post a professional post in agadmators video's.

Have to implement game room feature this will be very helpful.

We can also implement a admin mode where you can create your own game rooms($30/month) this will help you to engage your audience and create a chess community.

While I give you a couple of seconds.

What do you play here.

Find number of online players. Need this to show people.

My Recommendation

Start with Stockfish.js because:
1. ✅ Zero infrastructure cost
2. ✅ Scales automatically with users
3. ✅ Fast enough for 99% of use cases
4. ✅ Easy to implement (2-3 hours)
5. ✅ Same tech chess.com uses for free analysis

Add server-side later only if:
- You have premium tier that needs deeper analysis
- You want to offer "cloud analysis" as a feature
- You need to analyze many positions in batch

Would you like me to help implement the browser-based Stockfish.js solution first?

User should be able to see the last move played it should be able go back move by move.

Have to implement the back feature that user should be able to use last user move.(analyze chess.com website)

and when a random position loads, user should see the last move played by the side.


and the last move played on the board should be slightly highlighted.

while calling gemini api will also have to add information of the last move that was played, 

so that the players playing this positon have some more context, about what was the last move played by opponent.

Integrate with zustand to avoid , making calls to clerk api on every page and if it's calling clerk on every page, page loads in 1s not acceptable.

When user selects, a legend we try our best to match him with that legend, and when he tries to play with a bot he always plays as the legend he has chosen.


All the loading banners should be the same on all the pages.

Resignation , offer draw should also be handled.

What are baked in variable how are they different from runtime variables.

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

We can do something like whenever a user is trying to find a match, we can have a rough estimate of number of users online and we can show him a popup saying there are low online players right now , play with a bot.


give 30 seeconds to access position.

show the original game line after game has ended. 

Also we can show some sort of review of the game and till what point they player play same moves as the legend.


reconnection scenarios and testing and observability for quick match.


Create youtube channel, UI fixes, discord , and other communities , ToS, cookies and fix home page dummy data.

Observability and logs for web socket and list down happy flows and sleep with them in mind if a scenario click which can break thing fix it immediately.

Make a video of how it works.

Work on 2nd product and keep marketing it alongside.

Optimize for SEO.


If i share a link with someone and it does not working.

when from analysis page if someone click back button he should not go to game page, figure out a logic to take him to play page.

once we have sent an event after both the players have joined the game_start event then we should actively check for sometime and the client should sent a event back that game has actually started if we dont receive a event form client a game started event then we should again send that game_start event to that client maybe the packet got lost, otherwise the client will be struck on the joining screen forever.


And on joining screen also should have a 1 minute timeout that if after one minute, if the game does not start we should show client that unbale to load the game at the moment, please try after sometime.


Sending Notifications setup.


Once the app loads, will store the assests like images and videos in user local storage for better performance.

2x videos , just record a feture and 2x it an post.

When we fetch a request for homepage, we would like to call our profile api and clerk hook to fetch user data in asynchronous manner, 

and store it in local storage using zustand , that will make our pages incredibly fast.



Using the discussion below we can establish a web socket connection on homepage itself and use it when the user goes on to game page that way the game is already created and when user finally goes on game page he wont have to wait and see the loader again.

WebSocket Connections Across Page Navigations
Short answer: It depends on whether you're doing a full page navigation or a client-side navigation.

Full page navigation (window.location, <a> without SPA router)
Not possible. A full page load destroys the entire JavaScript runtime, including all WebSocket connections. You must establish a new connection on the new page. There's no way to "transfer" the socket.

Client-side navigation (Next.js router.push, <Link>)
Yes — this is what you want. In Next.js, client-side navigations don't reload the page. The JavaScript runtime stays alive, so a WebSocket connection created in a shared context (like a Zustand store, React context, or module-level singleton) will survive across route changes.

How to do it in your app
Since you're using Next.js + Zustand + socket.io-client, the typical pattern is:

Create the socket connection in a Zustand store or module-level singleton — not inside a page component
Initialize it once (e.g., in a layout or provider that wraps your routes)
Access it from any page via the store

// stores/socket-store.ts
import { io, Socket } from 'socket.io-client';
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface SocketStore {
  socket: Socket | null;
  connect: () => void;
  disconnect: () => void;
}

export const useSocketStore = create<SocketStore>((set, get) => ({
  socket: null,
  connect: () => {
    if (get().socket) return; // already connected
    const socket = io('your-server-url');
    set({ socket });
  },
  disconnect: () => {
    get().socket?.disconnect();
    set({ socket: null });
  },
}));
Then in your queue page, you call connect(). When the user navigates to /game/[gameId] via router.push(), the socket stays alive and the game page reads from the same store.

Key caveat
If the user refreshes the page or types a URL manually, the socket is gone and you'll need to reconnect. Your game page should always handle the case where the socket doesn't exist yet and reconnect if needed.
